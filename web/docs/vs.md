There is no shortage of starter kits out there, and you may be wondering how the projects in Decoupled Kit compare. Here are a few main reasons why we think Decoupled Kit might be right for you:

- Focused on sourcing data from a CMS
- Framework agnostic tools
- Simplified configuration
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Optimized for Pantheon

We hope this project can be useful for you, be it as a reference implementation, or to import that one specific package that has exactly the utility you need. That said, we also love the many other projects that make the modern web a better place and are excited to see them running on Pantheon when they are right for you. Here's a sampling of some comparable projects, and how they differ.
